    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div id="privacy-content">
        <p><strong>1. Information Collection:</strong> Boykin’s Finest Kennels (“We” or “Seller”) collects personal information such as name, email, phone number, and address when you submit a puppy application, contact us via email (<a href="mailto:boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com">boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com</a>), or use our website. We may also collect usage data (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages visited) to improve our website and related applications.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Data Use:</strong> We use your information to process applications, respond to inquiries, coordinate puppy pickups, fulfill contractual obligations, and enhance our website or app functionality. Usage data may be analyzed to optimize user experience. We do not sell or trade your personal data. Sharing occurs only with your consent, with service providers under strict confidentiality agreements, or as required by law.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Legal Basis:</strong> Data collection is based on your consent, contractual necessity (e.g., puppy sales), or our legitimate interest in improving our services, consistent with applicable federal and state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA).</p>
        <p><strong>4. Data Storage:</strong> Personal data is stored on encrypted servers accessible only to authorized personnel. Usage data is anonymized where possible. Data is retained for five (5) years post-transaction for record-keeping and compliance, then securely deleted, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Cookies and Tracking:</strong> Our website may use cookies or similar technologies to collect usage data for functionality and improvement purposes. You may disable cookies via your browser settings, though this may affect site performance. No unnecessary persistent identifiers are stored without consent.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Your Rights:</strong> You have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your personal data, or opt out of data processing for non-essential purposes (e.g., website improvement). Submit requests to <a href="mailto:boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com">boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within thirty (30) days, or sooner if required by law (e.g., 10 days under CCPA for opt-out verification). Residents of certain states (e.g., California, Virginia) may have additional rights, including opting out of data sales (not applicable here).</p>
        <p><strong>7. Security:</strong> We implement industry-standard encryption, access controls, and regular security audits to protect your data. However, no system is fully immune to breaches, and we are not liable for unauthorized access beyond our reasonable control.</p>
        <p><strong>8. Children’s Privacy:</strong> Our services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If discovered, such data will be deleted immediately, per the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
        <p><strong>9. Updates:</strong> This policy may be updated periodically. Changes are effective upon posting. Significant updates will be communicated via email or website notice where required by law (e.g., CCPA). Review this page regularly.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Contact:</strong> For questions or concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com">boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com</a> or Boykin’s Finest Kennels, [Insert Physical Address], South Carolina.</p>
